script
    # The minUptime and spinSleepTime settings stop Forever from thrashing if
    # the application fails immediately on launch. This is generally necessary to
    # avoid loading development servers to the point of failure every time 
    # someone makes an error in application initialization code, or bringing down
    # production servers the same way if a database or other critical service
    # suddenly becomes inaccessible.

pre-stop script
    # Here we're using the pre-stop script to stop the Node.js application
    # process so that Forever is given a chance to do its thing and tidy up
    # its data. Note that doing it this way means that each application that
    # runs under Forever must have a different start file name, regardless of
    # which directory it is in.
